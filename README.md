# ðŸ—½ New York City Taxi Trip Duration


## Running
1. Clone repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/asa-eve/New-York-City-Taxi-Trip-Duration.git`
2. Prepare data
    - download competition datasets from official
    - get hands on external datasets
      - [Weather dataset in NYC 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathijs/weather-data-in-new-york-city-2016)
      - estimate of the fastest routes for each trip using Open Source Routing Machine (will require some internet searching)
3. Lauching (Git Bash & Jupyter)
   - either using `.sh` files, or by following notebooks

## ðŸ“Š Competition Overview

This project is based on [New York City Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration) the competition hosted on Kaggle.
- based on the [2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-tlc-trips) record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform

### Objective
Predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City using features such as pickup/dropoff coordinates, timestamps, and passenger count.
**Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### **Dataset Summary**:
- `train.csv`: 1,458,644 trip records
- `test.csv`: 625,134 trip records

### **Features**:
- `pickup_datetime`, `dropoff_datetime`
- `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`
- `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`
- `passenger_count`, `vendor_id`, `store_and_fwd_flag`
- `trip_duration` (target variable)

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Very helpful [notebook to follow in R](https://www.kaggle.com/code/headsortails/nyc-taxi-eda-update-the-fast-the-curious/report).
Good insights:
1. **Simple visualization**
   - most of the trips are around Manhatten (notable places are airports - JFK & La Guardia)
       - from January to July of 2016 
   - `trip duration` - shows potential outliers for removal
   - `pickup / dropout` dates / count - failry homogeneous, drops late January - early February (winter)
   - `store and fwd flag` - shows that usually no storing of data happened (<0.5%)
   - `week day` vs. `number of pickups` - monday (least common), friday (most common)
   - `hour` vs. `number of pickups` - drops (4-5 am & 4-5 pm), probably working hours
2. **Feature relation** (with target)
   - `trip duration` vs. `hour/week day` - shows strong relation and influence
   - `trip duration` vs. `passenger count` -
   - `density` vs. `trip duration` (by vendor) - close medians (~660s mark), with `vendor 2` having heavier right tail inflating its mean (1059s against 845s)
   - `store and fwd flag` vs. `trip duration` - minimal difference in flags data
3. **Feature engineering**
   - `trip duration` vs. `direct distance` (calculated by Cosine law distance)
7. **Anomalies detection & removal**
8. **External datasets features**
9. **Correlation** (with target)
10. **Classification feature** ???

## ðŸ¤– Model Training & Results
After EDA (non-linear feature relationships) it became obvious - that regression models will perform worse. But the strategy of applying 3-4 methods right away is useful (simple, average(2), complex(2)), so I ended up with:

  Model | RMSE
  --- | --- 
  `Ridge regression` (poly features) | 0.4150
  `XGBoost` | 0.3494
  `LightGBM` | 0.3485
  `Stacking` (all 3) | 0.3459

This result is top 1% (of public scores).
